# mod_performance

This is usual Apache module for Linux (CentOS, RedHat, Fedora, Debian, OpenSuse) which can: 1) accumulate requests resource usage; 2) gives ability to analize stored data. It takes such parameters of request as:

    requested virtualhost;
    requested file;
    URI;
    CPU usage %;
    Memory usage %;
    I/O usage;
    execution time;

Collected info can be stored in SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL database or in text file. Moduleâ€™s filter provide an opportunity to save only especial requests (for example only php scripts).

Module can work with such apache configurations:

    Apache mod_php (prefork, worker, event);
    Apache itk + mod_php;
    Apache mod_ruid2 + mod_php
    Apache + suphp (patched by mod_performance patch)
    Apache + php-fpm (patched by mod_performance patch)
